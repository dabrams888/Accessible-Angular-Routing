<p>Have you ever wanted the thrill of a lifetime?</p>
<p>Are you ok with that lifetime being incredibly short?</p>
<p>Sounds like you need a Dragon!</p>
<p>
  Dragons live for a super long time and are entirely self-sufficient. The eat a
  lot, but hey it's not like you have control over their diet anyway so let them
  go at it!
</p>
<p>
  If you don't think you're up for the challenge, then try one of these lesser
  creature:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a routerLink="/Cats" [state]="{ isNavigating: true }"> Cats </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a routerLink="/Dogs" [state]="{ isNavigating: true }"> Dogs </a>
  </li>
</ul>
