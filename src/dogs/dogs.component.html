<h1 tabIndex="-1" appRouteTarget>Dogs</h1>
<p>
  Dogs require a lot of attention, but make great companions. Take them on
  regular walks and make sure they get plenty of exercise.

<p>
  If you don't think you're up to the challenge of having a dog, try a&nbsp;
  <a routerLink="/Cats" [state]="{ isNavigating: true }"> Cat </a>
  &nbsp;instead!
</p>
<p>
  Or, if you want a real challenge, check out a&nbsp;
  <a routerLink="/Dragons" [state]="{ isNavigating: true }"> Dragon </a>
  !
